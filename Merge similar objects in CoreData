If you want Core Data to write the changes, you need to open SceneDelegate.swift and add this import:

import CoreData
Now add this line in the willConnectTo method, directly below the code that starts let context:

context.mergePolicy = NSMergeByPropertyObjectTrumpMergePolicy
That asks Core Data to merge duplicate objects based on their properties â€“ it tries to intelligently overwrite the version in its database using properties from the new version.
